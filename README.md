# TLC59208 Rust Driver

> A WIP, no_std, generic driver for the TLC59208 IC (8 channel LED driver)

## What works

- Baseline configuration of device parameters
- Methods to set & update channel PWM values
- Methods to set RGB LED PWM values (with an assumed RGB <> channel mapping)

## TODO

- [ ] Provide usage examples
- [ ] Configurable RGB <> channel mapping
- [ ] Support for other configuration of chip parameters (e.g. global diming, blink frequency)

## Examples

TBD
